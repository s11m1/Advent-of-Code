# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

This repo contains my [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions in Python.

The aim is to provide a simple and easy to follow solution - do not expect any fluffy libraries or extravagant objects.
Unicorns are also not provided, unfortunately.

Since I only started with the Advent of Code in 2022 there are only solutions for this year and only in Python. The
solutions for the previous years and solutions in other languages will follow as I go on.
